        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="aboutimg.jpg" alt="About Me Image">
        <p>
            After graduating in 2021 with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree (First
            Class Honours) in Multimedia Programming and Design, I spent the last
            nine years working both as a freelance web developer and designer and as
            part of a team in various companies across Galway, Dublin, Berlin, and
            Melbourne. I acquired project and time management skills, as well as the
            ability to communicate with team members and clients while effectively
            meeting milestones and deadlines.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a freelance web developer and designer, I
            collaborated with several graphic designers in Berlin and Melbourne, at
            the same time maintaining clients in Germany, Ireland, Australia, and
            the UK.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have worked on a multitude of web and print-based
            projects for a range of clients providing Web Design (Photoshop,
            Illustrator, InDesign) and Development (PHP, HTML, CSS, LESS, JS,
            jQuery, WordPress, WooCommerce, Bootstrap, Responsive Layouts),
            eCommerce Solutions, Corporate Branding, and Graphic Design. During my
            Multimedia degree, I studied Information Architecture, and therefore
            have a keen understanding of wireframes, sitemaps, and user experience
            design which I put to good use on every project I work on.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently working in Ireland between Dublin and
            Galway. I am always available to discuss your project over the phone or
            via Skype. These days I enjoy spending my free time riding my bike,
            baking, and crocheting.
